what can you tell about built in groups in win server22  DC
ChatGPT said:

In Windows Server 2022 running as a Domain Controller (DC), there are a number of built-in security groups created automatically. These groups are defined in Active Directory (AD) and are used to assign default permissions and rights. Below is a detailed overview:
🔐 Built-in Groups in AD on a DC (Windows Server 2022)

These groups are found in the "Builtin" container in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) or under CN=Builtin,DC=... in ADSI Edit.
Group Name	Scope	Purpose
Administrators	Domain Local	Full control over the domain and DCs. Members are Domain Admins by default.
Users	Domain Local	All domain users automatically belong here. Used for default access permissions.
Guests	Domain Local	Very limited access. By default, includes the Guest account.
Backup Operators	Domain Local	Can back up and restore files (even if not the owner), log on locally.
Account Operators	Domain Local	Can create/manage user accounts, but cannot modify Admins/Domain Controllers.
Server Operators	Domain Local	Can log on to DCs, manage shared resources, start/stop services. Used mostly in older setups.
Print Operators	Domain Local	Manage printers and queues on domain controllers.
Replicator	Domain Local	Used by the File Replication Service (FRS) (legacy) for replication. Do not use for users.
Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access	Domain Local	Gives read access to AD for users without requiring NTLM permissions. Rarely needed.
Incoming Forest Trust Builders	Domain Local	Can create one-way incoming trusts from another forest.
Network Configuration Operators	Domain Local	Can make limited changes to networking configuration.
Remote Desktop Users	Domain Local	Members can log on via Remote Desktop. Useful if RDP is enabled.
Cryptographic Operators	Domain Local	Can manage cryptographic operations, like key services.
DnsAdmins	Domain Local	Manage DNS Server settings (if DC is a DNS server).
DnsUpdateProxy	Domain Local	Used for dynamic DNS updates by DHCP clients.
🧠 Special Notes:

    On Domain Controllers, local groups are replaced by Domain Local groups in AD.

    Built-in groups cannot be deleted but can be renamed.

    Some groups like Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins are found in the "Users" container, not Builtin — but they are also "built-in" in functionality.

🔧 Common Scenarios:

    Use Administrators for full server/domain control.

    Use Account Operators to delegate user/group management without full admin rights.

    Use Remote Desktop Users to allow specific users to log on to DCs via RDP (not recommended for security).

    Use DnsAdmins if you delegate DNS zone administration.

If you're planning to delegate permissions, it's better to create custom groups and assign roles with Group Policy or ACLs, rather than adding users directly to built-in groups — especially high-privilege ones like Administrators.

Would you like a diagram, PowerShell list of members, or explanation of Domain Admins vs. Enterprise Admins too?

why it is needed to create account group - computers in win server 22 dc . Isnt enough to have Users. Why do they exist
ChatGPT said:

Great question! Here's a corrected and clear version of what you're asking:

"Why is it necessary to have the built-in group 'Computers' in Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller? Isn't it enough to just have the 'Users' group? Why does the 'Computers' group exist?"
Answer:

The "Computers" container (not a group) in Active Directory is a default Organizational Unit (OU) (or more precisely, a container) where newly joined domain computers are placed by default.

Here's why it exists and why it's needed:
✅ Purpose of the 'Computers' Container

    Default location for domain-joined computers
    When you join a Windows machine to a domain and don’t specify an OU, it gets placed automatically in the Computers container.

    Separation of objects
    Active Directory organizes users, computers, groups, and other objects into different containers to keep things manageable and apply different policies.

    GPO targeting
    Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can be applied differently to users and computers. Having them in separate containers helps with targeted policy management.

    Security and Delegation
    Keeping users and computers in different containers allows you to assign administrative rights more securely and delegate management tasks more precisely.

🤔 Why not just use 'Users'?

    The 'Users' container is for user accounts, service accounts, and some built-in groups.

    Computers are not users; they are machine objects and need different handling.

    Mixing them would make administration, automation, and GPO deployment confusing and harder to manage.

🔧 Best Practice

Most organizations create their own custom OUs (like OU=Workstations, OU=Servers) and move computers out of the default Computers container to apply better GPOs and structure.

Do you mean that every new computer in domain gets into computers group 
ChatGPT said:

You're very close! Here's the corrected version of your question:

    Do you mean that every new computer in the domain gets placed into the 'Computers' group?

Corrected Answer:

Not exactly — but you're on the right track.

Let me explain clearly:
❗ 'Computers' is not a group, it's a container in Active Directory.

    When you join a computer to the domain (for example, from Windows 10 or Windows 11), that computer gets added as a computer object in the CN=Computers container by default, unless you specify another OU.

    So yes, every newly joined computer is stored in the Computers container, not a group, unless you redirect it.

💡 What's the difference between a group and a container?
Term	Purpose
Group	A list of users or computers used for permissions, roles, etc.
Container	An organizational structure in AD that holds objects like users, groups, or computers.
🔄 Example:

If you run:

Get-ADComputer -Filter * -SearchBase "CN=Computers,DC=yourdomain,DC=com"

You’ll see all computers that were automatically added there when joined to the domain.

thanks for correction english
Explain please. When in rights administering is necessary computer account
ChatGPT said:

You're welcome! Here's your corrected question:

    Please explain: when is a computer account needed for administering rights?

✅ What is a computer account in Active Directory?

When you join a Windows computer to the domain, Active Directory creates a computer account for it. This account is used to:

    Authenticate the computer to the domain.

    Allow secure communication between the computer and the domain controller.

    Apply Group Policies.

    Allow administrators to manage the computer remotely via tools like GPO, PowerShell, WMI, etc.

🛠️ When is a computer account used for rights and administration?

Here are some key scenarios:
1. Group Policy Application

    Group Policies (GPOs) are applied based on computer accounts and user accounts.

    If you want to apply a GPO to a group of machines (e.g. install software, disable USB), you target the computer accounts.

2. Delegating Administrative Control

    You can delegate rights to manage only certain computer accounts in Active Directory to helpdesk staff or admins.

    For example: allow a junior admin to reset a computer account password or rejoin it to the domain.

3. Security Filtering

    If you have a GPO that should apply only to specific machines, you can create a group, add computer accounts to it, and filter the policy accordingly.

4. Remote Management

    Tools like Remote Desktop, PowerShell Remoting, SCCM, Intune, and WMI often use the computer account to authenticate to the domain and manage itself securely.

5. Authentication and Access Control

    When a user logs in to a domain computer, both the user account and the computer account authenticate to the domain.

    File servers can use the identity of the computer account to grant or deny access to network shares.

🔐 Example:

Imagine you have a shared folder with access restricted to only certain computers (e.g., only computers in the OU=Finance). You can use computer accounts in security groups to control access.

Would you like an example with a PowerShell command or a diagram showing this process?
