Im learning win server 22. I have a DC dc22.ad.simulate.at.home and child.dc22.ad.simulate.at.home both with win server22. And one computer win 10 as a memer of domain. They are all installed on VM, 
I need to learn a questions
what is group nesting how it work
what is role based access control
ChatGPT said:

Great, you're diving into two essential topics for managing access and permissions in Windows Server environments:
✅ 1. What is Group Nesting and How It Works

Group Nesting means adding one group as a member of another group. This helps organize permissions more efficiently.
🔹 Why Use Group Nesting?

To avoid assigning users to all resource-specific groups directly. Instead, use layers:

    Assign users to role groups

    Assign role groups to resource groups

This follows the AGDLP or AGUDLP model, depending on your domain level.
🔸 Models:
🧱 AGDLP (used in single-domain environments):

    A = Accounts (users)

    G = Global groups (role-based)

    DL = Domain Local groups (resource-based)

    P = Permissions

✅ Users → Global Groups → Domain Local Groups → Permissions

Example:

    User1 is in GG_HR

    GG_HR is in DL_HR_Share_Read

    DL_HR_Share_Read has read permission to a folder

🌐 AGUDLP (used in multi-domain forests):

    Adds Universal groups between global and domain local groups to work across domains.

✅ 2. What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC means assigning permissions based on roles, not individual users. It's a key principle in least privilege access.
🔹 Core Concepts:

    Roles = Represent job functions (e.g., "HR Manager", "IT Support")

    Permissions = What that role can do (e.g., read HR documents, reset passwords)

    Users = Assigned to roles

🔸 RBAC in Windows Server:

Windows doesn’t have a strict RBAC engine like Azure AD, but you can simulate RBAC using:

    Security groups to represent roles

    Assign those groups permissions (on files, OU delegation, services, etc.)

Example:

    Create IT_Helpdesk role (a security group)

    Assign it "Reset password" permission on a specific OU

    Add helpdesk users to this group

They will inherit access via their group membership, not through direct user permissions.
🧠 TL;DR:
Concept Summary
Group Nesting   Add groups inside other groups to manage permissions hierarchically
Role-Based Access Ctrl  Assign access to roles (groups) instead of users, then put users in roles

If you'd like, I can guide you through a practical lab to set up both concepts in your VMs — just say the word.

Lets tomorrow I go to sleep
ChatGPT said:

Sounds good! Get a good night's rest — we’ll dive into the lab tomorrow when you’re ready. Sleep well! 🌙💤
You said:
well. how is it in english I am aware or woke up
ChatGPT said:

Good question!

    ✅ “I’m aware” = Я усвідомлюю / Я знаю

        It means you know something — you're conscious of information or a fact.

    ✅ “I woke up” = Я прокинувся

        It means you just came out of sleep — you’re now physically awake.

So:

    “I’m aware” = mental understanding

    “I woke up” = physical awakening from sleep

🔹 Example:

    “I just woke up, and now I’m aware that today is Monday.”

Let me know if you want similar comparisons — it's a great way to improve!
You said:
so I woke up. Lets begin lab 
ChatGPT said:

Welcome back! Let’s start your Windows Server 2022 lab on:
✅ Group Nesting
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

You have:

    dc22.ad.simulate.at.home — Root Domain Controller

    child.dc22.ad.simulate.at.home — Child Domain Controller

    A Windows 10 domain-joined client

🔧 LAB GOAL:

    Set up nested groups using AGDLP

    Simulate role-based access control to a shared folder

🧪 STEP 1: Create OU and Groups on DC

On dc22 (your root DC):
💼 Create OU:

Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
➡️ Right-click your domain → New → Organizational Unit

    Name it: Company

Under Company, create:

    OU: Groups

    OU: Users

👥 Create Groups (for AGDLP model)
In Groups OU:
Group Name  Scope   Type    Purpose
GG_HR_Employees Global  Security    Role group: HR users
DL_HR_Share_Read    Domain Local    Security    Resource group: share access
🧪 STEP 2: Create Test User

In Users OU:

➡️ Create a test user: Serhii Hr

    Username: shr

    Password: P@ssw0rd (or similar)

    Set "User must change password at next logon" to unchecked

➡️ Add shr to GG_HR_Employees
🧪 STEP 3: Nest the Groups

In ADUC:
➡️ Open properties of DL_HR_Share_Read
➡️ Go to Members tab
➡️ Add GG_HR_Employees

✅ Now you have:

    shr → in GG_HR_Employees

    GG_HR_Employees → in DL_HR_Share_Read

🧪 STEP 4: Create Shared Folder and Assign Permissions

On dc22 or a file server:

➡️ Create a folder: C:\HR_Share
➡️ Right-click → Properties → Sharing tab

    Click Advanced Sharing

        Share name: HR_Share

        Permissions: Add DL_HR_Share_Read, give Read

➡️ Go to Security tab:

    Add DL_HR_Share_Read, give Read

🧪 STEP 5: Test as User

On your Windows 10 client:

    Log in as: shr@dc22.ad.simulate.at.home

    Press Win + R, type:

    \\dc22\HR_Share

    You should see the folder contents (empty or test file)

✅ Access works through nested groups — this is Group Nesting + RBAC in action.

Would you like to add:

    Modify/write access for another role?

    Do the same in child domain?

    See how delegation works in RBAC (e.g., reset password rights)?

Let’s keep going based on what you want to master next.
You said:
lets see delegation in action
ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Let’s explore delegation — a key part of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
🎯 GOAL:

Delegate "Reset password" permission to a helpdesk user — without giving them full admin rights.
🧪 STEP 1: Create a Helpdesk User and Group

On dc22.ad.simulate.at.home:
👤 Create Helpdesk User:

In ADUC under Company → Users:

    Username: helpdesk

    Full name: Helpdesk Staff

    Password: P@ssw0rd (disable password change at first login)

👥 Create Helpdesk Group:

In Company → Groups:

    Group name: GG_Helpdesk

    Type: Global, Scope: Security

➡️ Add user helpdesk to GG_Helpdesk
🧪 STEP 2: Choose OU to Delegate Access

Let’s say we want helpdesk to manage passwords of HR users only.

In ADUC:

    Right-click Company → Users

    Choose Delegate Control

🧪 STEP 3: Delegate Permission

The Delegation of Control Wizard opens:

    Welcome screen → Click Next

    Select Users or Groups → Click Add

        Type: GG_Helpdesk → OK → Next

    Choose Tasks to Delegate:

        Select: ✅ Reset user passwords and force password change at next logon
        → Next → Finish

✅ Now What?

The helpdesk user can:

    Open Active Directory Users and Computers

    Navigate to Company → Users

    Right-click a user like shr → Reset Password will be enabled

But helpdesk cannot:

    Delete users

    Modify group membership

    Change account name

🔒 This is least privilege delegation — a core principle in RBAC.
🧪 STEP 4: Test as Helpdesk

    Log in to your Windows 10 client as helpdesk@dc22.ad.simulate.at.home

    Open ADUC (you can install RSAT if not available):

        Run: dsa.msc

    Try:

        Reset password for shr ✅

        Create or delete users ❌ — should be denied

Want to try more?

    Delegate Join computer to domain?

    Delegate user creation rights?

    Do similar setup in child domain?

Let me know how deep you want to go!

how to install  RSAT
ChatGPT said:

Great! To manage Active Directory (and other server roles) from your Windows 10 client, you’ll need to install RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools).

Here’s how:
🧰 Install RSAT on Windows 10 (1809 and later)

Since Windows 10 version 1809, RSAT is built-in as an optional feature.
🔹 Step-by-step:

    Open Settings
    Press Win + I → Apps

    Click Optional Features
    (Right side → under “Apps & features”)

    Click + Add a feature

    Search for:

        RSAT: Active Directory Users and Computers

        Full name: RSAT: Active Directory Tools

    Click Install
    (Wait a few minutes)

✅ After Install

Open Active Directory Users and Computers:

    Press Win + R → type dsa.msc → Enter

You now have the ADUC console on your Windows 10 machine.
🧭 Bonus: Other Useful RSAT Tools You Can Add

You can install any of these via "Add a feature" too:
Tool    Description
RSAT: DNS Server Tools  Manage DNS remotely
RSAT: Group Policy Management Tools Manage GPOs
RSAT: DHCP Server Tools Manage DHCP remotely
RSAT: Server Manager    Manage roles and services
RSAT: AD Certificate Services   Manage CA roles

Let me know if:

    You want to install via PowerShell

    You're on an older version of Windows 10

    You want to install RSAT on Windows 11 or Server OS

We can tailor the steps!
You said:
is internet connection is needed to installl these features
ChatGPT said:

✅ Yes — an internet connection is required to install RSAT features on Windows 10 version 1809 and newer (and Windows 11).
🔍 Why?

RSAT is no longer a separate download — it’s part of the Windows image, but only as "Features on Demand". Windows will:

    Download the specific feature (like RSAT: Active Directory Tools) from Microsoft’s servers

    Install it using Windows Update service

⚠️ If no internet:

You’ll get errors like:

    “The following feature couldn’t be installed.”

🛠️ Workarounds if no Internet:

    Temporarily connect to the internet just for installation

    Use a WSUS server with RSAT features available (enterprise environments)

    Use DISM with a Features-on-Demand ISO (advanced, large download)

Let me know your setup and if you're offline permanently — I can guide you through an offline installation if needed.

Great question! Understanding the difference between Global and Domain Local group scopes is key to mastering Active Directory group strategy like AGDLP and RBAC.
🧩 What is Group Scope?

Group scope defines where a group can be used and who can be added to it.
🔍 1. Global Group (GG)
✅ Used for:

    Representing roles (e.g., departments, job functions)

    Grouping users from the same domain

✅ Who can be a member?

    Only users and groups from the same domain

✅ Where can it be used?

    Can be assigned permissions in any domain in the forest (including trusting forests)

📌 Example:

Group: GG_HR_Employees

    Contains users like shr, irina, etc. from dc22.ad.simulate.at.home

    Can be added to access control on a folder, even in child.dc22.ad.simulate.at.home

🔍 2. Domain Local Group (DL)
✅ Used for:

    Assigning permissions to resources (folders, printers) within the same domain

✅ Who can be a member?

    Users, global groups, and universal groups from any domain

    ✅ Very flexible in who you can add

✅ Where can it be used?

    Can only assign permissions to resources in the same domain where the group exists

📌 Example:

Group: DL_HR_Share_Read

    Can include GG_HR_Employees, even from another domain

    Can be assigned permissions to a shared folder on a file server in dc22.ad.simulate.at.home only

📊 Summary Table:
Feature Global Group    Domain Local Group
Use for Representing roles  Assigning permissions
Can contain Users & groups from same domain Users & groups from any trusted domain
Can assign permissions in   Any domain  Only in its own domain
Best used as    Member of resource groups   Permission holders
✅ Example in AGDLP:
Level   Name    Scope   Purpose
A (Accounts)    shr —   HR employee
G   GG_HR_Employees Global  HR role group
DL  DL_HR_Share_Read    Domain Local    Share access group
P   Permissions —   Assigned to folder

Let me know if you’d like to visualize this in a diagram or try it in your lab!
You said:
Search for:

    RSAT: Active Directory Users and Computers

    Full name: RSAT: Active Directory Tools
It doesnt find anything
ChatGPT said:

Thanks — let’s fix that. If RSAT: Active Directory Users and Computers or RSAT: Active Directory Tools is not found, here are a few key things to check and try:
✅ 1. Check Windows 10 Version

Only Windows 10 version 1809 or newer supports RSAT via “Optional Features”.
🔍 How to check:

Run in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

winver

✅ You should see something like:

    Version 22H2 (OS Build 19045.xxx)

If you’re on older than 1809, RSAT must be downloaded separately from the Microsoft website.
✅ 2. Correct Search Term

In “Optional Features”, you may need to search by exact name:

    Open: Settings → Apps → Optional Features → Add a feature

    Search for:

    RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Services

That package includes Active Directory Users and Computers (dsa.msc), even if the name is misleading.
✅ 3. Try PowerShell Install

If GUI doesn’t work, run this in PowerShell as Administrator:

Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0"

✅ This will install:

    Active Directory Users and Computers (dsa.msc)

    Active Directory Sites and Services

    Active Directory Domains and Trusts

✅ 4. Check for Internet and Windows Update

The install pulls from Microsoft’s servers.
Make sure:

    Your PC has internet access

    Windows Update is not blocked or disabled

Try running:

Get-WindowsUpdateLog

To verify it's working.
❌ Still Not Working?

Let me know:

    Your Windows 10 version

    Whether you're using a local admin or domain account

    Whether you're online or offline

I’ll guide you through offline installation or ISO-based methods if needed.
You said:
Do I righgt understand. If computer win 10 is added to a domain win 22 local administrator account wont get access only those created on domain controller
ChatGPT said:

You're mostly right, but let's clarify what happens with local accounts vs domain accounts after a Windows 10 computer is joined to a Windows Server 2022 domain.
🧠 Summary: What Happens After Domain Join
Account Type    Can Sign In After Domain Join?  Has Admin Access?
🔑 Local Administrator   ✅ Yes (still exists)    ✅ Yes, unless removed
👤 Other local users ✅ Yes   ❌ Unless made admin
👥 Domain users  ✅ Yes   ❌ Unless added to local Administrators group
🔍 Details:
✅ 1. Local Administrator (Built-in)

    Still exists after domain join

    Can log in locally or via .\Administrator

    Keeps full control unless removed from local admins group

🧠 .\Administrator means: local account named Administrator
🖥️ Used at login when you're trying to avoid domain account
✅ 2. Domain Accounts

    Domain users like serhii@dc22.ad.simulate.at.home can log in

    They have standard user rights by default

    You can grant admin access by:

        Adding them to the local Administrators group:

        Computer Management → Local Users and Groups → Groups → Administrators → Add

❌ 3. Local Accounts Are Not Domain Accounts

    You can’t log into a different computer with a local account unless that same local user exists there too

    Domain accounts are centrally managed, local accounts are not

✅ Best Practice in Enterprises

    Keep local Administrator account enabled but renamed for emergency

    Use domain groups (e.g., GG_IT_Admins) and add them to local Administrators group via Group Policy

Would you like to test this live in your lab?
I can walk you through:

    Creating a domain user

    Giving them local admin rights

    Logging in with .\Administrator after domain join

You said:
I logged in as Member\Admin locally to win 10
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — that confirms you're logged in using the local Administrator account on your Windows 10 machine, even though it's joined to the domain.

Let’s break that down so it's 100% clear.
✅ What Does Member\Admin Mean?

    Member = the computer's hostname (e.g., Member is the machine name)

    Admin = local user account on that machine

    You logged in as .\Admin or Member\Admin, which means:
    ➤ Use the local account “Admin” on this machine, not a domain account

🔍 Why Use .\Admin or Member\Admin?

Because once a computer joins a domain:

    Default login domain changes to the domain (e.g., dc22.ad.simulate.at.home)

    If you just type Admin, it assumes you mean dc22.ad.simulate.at.home\Admin (which probably doesn’t exist)

To force local login, you use:

    .\Admin

    or Member\Admin

    or select "Other user" → click “Sign in options” → choose “Local account”

🔐 Admin Rights

Logging in as Member\Admin gives you:

    Full local control (unless restricted)

    Access to tools like:

        Computer Management

        Local Users and Groups

        Installing RSAT (if not blocked by GPO)

But remember: it won’t give you domain access (like managing users in AD) unless you:

    Run tools and explicitly connect to domain

    Or log in with a domain account that has rights

✅ Summary
You Logged In As    What It Means   Level of Access
Member\Admin or .\Admin Local admin on that PC only Full access to local machine
dc22\shr or serhii@...  Domain user account Limited rights unless elevated

Would you like to now:

    Test logging in with a domain user?

    Add a domain user to local Administrators group on the Win 10 PC?

    Use Group Policy to automate that?

I can guide you step-by-step.

I loging in as enterprise admin to the DC - dc22 and just after getting access I receive mesage allow this programm ......   When starts server manager. why it asks me to allow it to run 
ChatGPT said:

Good observation — that prompt shouldn't normally appear when you're logged in as Enterprise Admin on a Windows Server 2022 machine like dc22. Here's what’s happening and how to fix it.
🧩 Why You're Seeing "Allow This Program" Prompt

When Server Manager starts after login, it's a UAC (User Account Control) prompt. Even though you're Enterprise Admin, Windows treats admin rights as separate unless elevated.
🔍 Possible Causes:

    ✅ UAC is Enabled:
    Windows Server protects the system by not running apps with admin rights by default, even for admin users.
    So Server Manager triggers UAC on first launch.

    ❌ Shortcut or .EXE is blocked:
    If you copied ServerManager.exe or its shortcut from another source (like a network share), Windows may mark it as untrusted.

    ⚠️ Compatibility Mode or SmartScreen might interfere.

✅ Fix Options (Choose based on security needs)
🛠️ Option 1: Unblock the Shortcut

If the shortcut or EXE is "blocked":

    Right-click the Server Manager shortcut (in Start or Desktop)

    Select Properties

    If you see a message like:

        “This file came from another computer and might be blocked...”
        ✅ Click Unblock

    Apply → OK

🔧 Option 2: Run Always as Administrator (if needed)

If Server Manager doesn't start elevated:

    Right-click the shortcut → Properties

    Go to Shortcut → Click Advanced

    ✅ Check Run as administrator

This will always run Server Manager with elevation.
⚙️ Option 3: Lower UAC (Not recommended on production servers)

You can adjust UAC settings if it's interrupting too much:

    Open Control Panel → User Accounts → Change User Account Control settings

    Set slider one level down to reduce prompts
    (Don't turn it off unless on a lab VM)

🔒 Important Security Note

Even Enterprise Admins are affected by UAC because:

    You are a member of the Administrators group, but you run programs without elevation unless explicitly allowed.

This is a security feature, not a bug.
✅ Best Practice

Keep UAC enabled.
Just unblock shortcuts, and make sure you’re using built-in tools, not copied .exe files from outside sources.

Let me know if:

    You want to disable the prompt completely

    You're seeing it on other programs too

    Server Manager fails to open even after confirming the prompt

Add a domain user to local Administrators group on the Win 10 PC?
ChatGPT said:

Great! Let’s add a domain user to the local Administrators group on your Windows 10 PC that is joined to the domain.
🎯 Goal:

Grant a domain user (e.g., shr@dc22.ad.simulate.at.home) local admin rights on one specific machine.
🧪 Option 1: Add via GUI (Computer Management)
✅ Step-by-step:

    Log in to the Win10 PC as a local admin (e.g., .\Admin)

    Press Win + X → click Computer Management

    Navigate to:

Local Users and Groups → Groups → Administrators

Double-click Administrators

Click Add

In the object field, type:

    dc22\shr

    or use Check Names to verify

    Click OK → Apply → OK

🟢 Now shr is a local administrator on that Win10 PC only.
🧪 Option 2: Use Command Line (CMD or PowerShell)
From an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell on the Win10 PC:

net localgroup Administrators dc22\shr /add

or in PowerShell:

Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "dc22\shr"

You should get:

    The command completed successfully.

🧪 Option 3: Do It from the Domain (Advanced)

If you want to do this for many PCs, you can:

    Use Group Policy Preferences

    Or run a remote PowerShell command

Let me know if you want to automate that across all clients.
✅ Test It

    Log off

    Log in to Win10 as shr@dc22.ad.simulate.at.home

    Open a command prompt → type:

whoami /groups

You should see:

    BUILTIN\Administrators

Let me know if:

    You want to remove the user later

    You want to do the same using GPO

    Or add a domain group instead of a user (recommended for real-world RBAC)

You said:
I have a user fox who uses suffix @dc22.home I want to add it on group policies on DC22 to the administrators local group on win 10 member
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — you're trying to add a domain user (fox@dc22.home) to the local Administrators group on a domain-joined Windows 10 machine, using Group Policy from DC22.

This is a common real-world RBAC task, and you're doing it the right way 💪
🎯 Goal:

Add user fox@dc22.home (or just dc22\fox) to the Administrators group on all or selected Win10 computers, using Group Policy Preferences.
✅ Step-by-Step via Group Policy (GPO)
🔸 1. Open Group Policy Management on DC22

On your DC:

    Start → gpmc.msc

    Or: Server Manager → Tools → Group Policy Management

🔸 2. Create or Edit a GPO

Choose how broadly you want to apply:
Option A: Affect all domain PCs

    Edit Default Domain Policy
    (not recommended unless you're sure)

Option B: Create a new GPO

    Right-click your OU (e.g., Company → Computers)

    Click Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here

    Name: Add fox to local admins

🔸 3. Edit the GPO

Right-click your GPO → Edit
Navigate to:

Computer Configuration →
  Preferences →
    Control Panel Settings →
      Local Users and Groups

🔸 4. Add User to Local Administrators Group

Right-click Local Users and Groups → New → Local Group

🛠️ Configure like this:
Field   Value
Action  Update
Group Name  Administrators (built-in)
Add → User  dc22\fox

    Click Add

    Enter dc22\fox → Click Check Names → OK

Leave other options default.

✅ This adds fox to local Administrators group on all computers targeted by this GPO.
🔸 5. Link GPO to Target Computers

Make sure this GPO is linked to an OU that contains the Windows 10 computer objects, like OU=Workstations or similar.
🔸 6. Force GPO Update on Win10

On your Windows 10 machine (member):

    Open CMD as admin

    Run:

gpupdate /force

You can also run:

    net localgroup administrators

    → to verify dc22\fox is now listed

✅ Result

Now, fox@dc22.home will be a local administrator on the targeted Windows 10 machine(s), without needing to touch each PC manually.

Would you like to:

    Add a group instead of a single user?

    Apply this GPO only to specific computers?

    Prevent removal of other existing admins?

Let me know!
You said:
I am logged as enterprise administrator oin dc22 but it says this programm is locked for your security attempting to run gpmc.msc
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the message “This program is blocked for your protection” (or "locked for your security") typically means that AppLocker, SmartScreen, or local security policies are blocking execution, even for Enterprise Admins.

Let’s fix this so you can run gpmc.msc (Group Policy Management Console) normally.
✅ 1. Verify the Error Source

Let’s confirm what’s blocking it.
🔍 Check exact message:

Does it say:

    "This app has been blocked for your protection"?

    "A system administrator has blocked you"?

    "This app is blocked by group policy"?

🛠 Fix Options Based on Cause
🔸 Option 1: Run gpmc.msc as Administrator

Even though you’re an admin, UAC might still block you.

Try:

    Press Win + S → Search for gpmc

    Right-click it → Run as administrator

If you get no option to run it, try via PowerShell:

Start-Process "gpmc.msc" -Verb RunAs

🔸 Option 2: Unblock the File (If It’s Marked from Another Source)

If gpmc.msc or its shortcut was copied (not native), it may be blocked:

    Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\gpmc.msc

    Right-click → Properties

    If you see “Unblock” checkbox on bottom right — ✅ check it

    Apply → OK

🔸 Option 3: Disable SmartScreen (TEMPORARILY for Lab)

You can disable SmartScreen for testing:

    Go to Control Panel → Security & Maintenance

    Click Change Windows SmartScreen settings

    Set to: Don’t do anything (turn off SmartScreen)

    🟠 Not recommended for production servers. Use only in lab.

🔸 Option 4: Check Local Group Policy

If blocked by Software Restriction Policies or AppLocker:

    Open gpedit.msc

    Go to:

    Computer Configuration →
      Windows Settings →
        Security Settings →
          Application Control Policies

    Look under:

        AppLocker

        Software Restriction Policies

If you see rules restricting MMC or MSC files, remove or relax them.
🔸 Option 5: Launch from MMC

Try launching gpmc.msc inside a custom MMC:

    Run: mmc

    File → Add/Remove Snap-in

    Choose Group Policy Management → Add

This bypasses some launcher restrictions.
✅ Last Resort

If everything fails, you can create a new GPO using PowerShell:

New-GPO -Name "Add Fox to Local Admins"

And then edit it with:

gpmc.msc

Let me know the exact error text, and I’ll give you the most precise solution.

Also: Are you using a hardened VM template or security baseline image? That could be enforcing these blocks.
