Have default local group - Administrators on domain controller the rights on another clients in domain such as win 10

When a server become DC are its groups locked or they still work

Can administrator of DC log in to remote computer as guest

Let's break your questions down one by one:
1. Does the default local group "Administrators" on a domain controller have rights on client machines (like Windows 10)?

No, not by default.

    The local "Administrators" group on a domain controller (e.g. dc22) only applies to that DC, and it doesn’t automatically give privileges on domain member computers (like Windows 10 machines).

    On Windows 10 clients, the local Administrators group can include domain accounts or groups (e.g., DOMAIN\Domain Admins) to give them admin rights on that machine.

✅ To ensure DC admins have local admin rights on clients:

    You should add a domain group like Domain Admins to the local Administrators group on clients.

    This is usually done via Group Policy:

        Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Restricted Groups or Group Policy Preferences.

2. When a server becomes a Domain Controller, are its local groups locked or still functional?

✅ They are transformed and partially "locked":

    When a machine is promoted to a DC:

        Local user accounts and local groups are removed.

        It now operates using Active Directory groups, such as:

            Domain Admins

            Enterprise Admins

            Administrators (now a domain-level group, not local)

    So the "Administrators" group still exists, but it's now a domain group, not a local one.

    You cannot create or manage local users or local groups on a DC anymore — everything is managed via Active Directory.

3. Can a Domain Controller Administrator log into a remote computer as Guest?

Technically, no, and usually not advisable:

    A DC admin (e.g., a member of Domain Admins) can log in to any domain-joined computer with full admin rights — but not as "Guest".

    The Guest account is a local, very limited account and is usually disabled by default.

    A DC admin should not use Guest — and usually cannot, unless:

        Guest is explicitly enabled.

        Password is set.

        Group policies allow it.

🛑 Logging in as Guest would:

    Bypass auditing and security logs for real admin activity.

    Violate best practices.

    Be blocked in hardened environments.

✅ Summary:
Question	Answer
Do DC "Administrators" have rights on clients?	❌ No, unless added to local groups or via GPO.
Are local groups on DC still functional?	🔒 No, they are replaced by domain groups.
Can DC admin log in as Guest?	🚫 Not by default, and it's not recommended.

Let me know if you want to automate granting admin rights on clients via Group Policy.

Ok. Then why having enterprise admin account and logging in to the child domain or even to the root DC I get warning that asks permissions to run server manager

Great question — and yes, this can be confusing.

You're an Enterprise Admin (EA), which is the highest-level group in an Active Directory forest, but when you log in — even to a Domain Controller — you still see a UAC (User Account Control) prompt asking for permission to run tools like Server Manager or GPMC?

Let’s break down why this happens:
🔒 Why You're Getting UAC Prompts Even as Enterprise Admin

    UAC Applies to All Admins by Design (Since Windows Vista / Server 2008):

        Even if you're in Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or Administrators, UAC splits your session into:

            A standard user token (used by default).

            An elevated admin token (used only when you explicitly approve elevation).

        That’s why Server Manager, PowerShell (admin), and others prompt you with "Do you want to allow this app...?"

    Enterprise Admin ≠ Automatic Elevation

        Being an Enterprise Admin doesn’t mean UAC is turned off or that elevation happens silently.

        By default, UAC protects even high-privilege accounts on servers, including domain controllers.

        It's a security feature, not a permissions issue.

    Server Manager is an Admin Tool — Requires Elevation

        Tools like Server Manager, GPMC, etc. require elevated privileges to modify system settings.

        Windows doesn't run them elevated unless you confirm via UAC.

⚙️ How to Reduce or Manage This Behavior

If you don’t want to be prompted every time, here are a few options (not all recommended for production):
✅ 1. Run tools explicitly as Administrator

    Right-click → “Run as administrator”

⚠️ 2. Disable UAC for Admins via Group Policy (not recommended on DCs)

    GPO setting:
    Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options >

        User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode → Set to: Elevate without prompting

        User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode → Disable (disables UAC entirely)

    ❗ WARNING: Disabling UAC on Domain Controllers is not recommended in production. It can weaken security and violate best practices.

✅ 3. Use a PowerShell session with elevation

Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb runAs

💡 TL;DR
Issue	Explanation
UAC prompt even as Enterprise Admin	Normal, expected, security by design
Why?	UAC separates standard and admin tokens for all users
Fix?	Use “Run as administrator” or adjust UAC (cautiously)
